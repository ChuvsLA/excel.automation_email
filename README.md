# excel.automation_email
I crafted a Python solution using os, datetime, pandas, and win32com.client to efficiently consolidate data from multiple Excel files. Leveraging Pandas for data manipulation, I formatted information and created a dynamic, consolidated chart. The project automates the entire process, including email dispatch using win32com.client.
